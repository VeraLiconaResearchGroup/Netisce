The search for effective therapeutic targets in fields like regenerative medicine and cancer research has generated interest in cell fate reprogramming. This cellular reprogramming paradigm can drive cells to a desired target state from any initial state. However, methods for identifying reprogramming targets remain limited for biological systems that lack large sets of experimental data or a dynamical characterization. We present NETISCE, a novel computational tool for identifying cell fate reprogramming targets in static networks. NETISCE identifies reprogramming targets through the innovative use of control theory within a dynamical systems framework. Through validations in studies of cell fate reprogramming from developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology, we show that NETISCE can predict previously identified cell fate reprogramming targets and identify potentially novel combinations of targets. NETISCE extends cell fate reprogramming studies to larger-scale biological networks without the need for full model parameterization and can be implemented by experimental and computational biologists to identify parts of a biological system that are relevant for the desired reprogramming task. For more information, please see the accompanying paper: Or biorxiv version: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.474582v1 This manual contains instructions for installing the NETISCE pipeline tool and accessing the Galaxy Project GUI web-based tool. We provide a simple toy example walkthrough tutorial. Lastly, we include instructions for reproducing NETISCE cell reprogramming results in developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology.

However, we provide two Nextflow pipelines, one designed for hpcs (NETISCE_hpc), and another for running NETISCE on a local machine (NETISCE_local). 2.2 Install Nextflow Nextflow is required to run the NETISCE pipeline. Please follow the instructions from https://www.nextflow.io/ (see ‘Getting Started’ steps 1 &amp; 2) to install Nextflow in the appropriate NETISCE folder (_local or _hpc). Note: if you are on a Windows Machine, you will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install 2.3 Prerequisuites Please be sure you have the following Python packages installed: scipy version=1.5.4 pandas version=1.1.5 sklearn version=0.24.2 yellowbrick version=1.3.post1 As well as the following R packages: dplyr ggplot2 plyr reshape2 readr which can be installed through CRAN. A Note about R packages NETISCE was originally constructed and run using R version 3.6.3. However, it has also been tested and functions in R version 4.0.4. The in NETISCE_hpc we specify for R scripts to use R/3.6.3 and have included the relevant R packages within the bin folder in an effort to alleviate potential package installation issues when using an hpc. 2.4 Docker Image If you are interested, we additionally provide a Docker container which has all required packages and code loaded to run NETISCE. It can be downloaded here After downloading the image, it can be unpacked using docker image load -i netisce.tar. Then, you can run the container with docker run ubuntu:NETISCE. (note, depending on your system, you may need to use sudo commands) 2.5 Parameters and Configuration Whether on your local machine or hpc, to run NETISCE you must specify the files and parameters within the .nf file params.expressions: csv file containing normalized expression data for network nodes in different samples params.network: network file (sif format) params.samples: text file specifying the phenotype for each sample in params.expressions file (tab delimited) params.internal_control: text file containing a list of nodes to be used as internal marker nodes params.alpha: alpha parameter for signal flow analysis (default =0.9) params.undesired: string of the undesired phenotype (as labeled in the params.samples file) params.desired: string of the desired phenotype (as labeled in the params.samples file) params.filter: filtering parameter for criterion 2 (“strict” or “relaxed”) params.kmeans_min_val: minimum k-means value for clustering (default=2) params.kmeans_max_val: maximum k-means value for clustering (default=10) params.num_nodes: number of nodes in network for which normalized expression data exists (within the params.expressions file) params.num_states: number of randomly generated initial states (default=100000, or 3^n where n is the number of network nodes and 3^n is less than 100000) params.randseed: random seed to generate one FVS of a network. Note: If you are interested in identifying all FVSes within a network, and using this information to specifically select a FVS, please see the additional folder and Nextflow script in the FVS_finding folder. Detailed description of the input and output is below. Please see the input_data folder for examples of files to match the formatting. 2.5.1 NETISCE_mutations.nf If you are interested in including mutational information, please use the NETISCE_mutations.nf pipeline. You must additionally specify params.mutations: a csv file containing mutational configuration for network nodes (0 for loss of function, 1 for gain of function). Please see example in input_data for formatting. 2.5.2 nextflow.config If you are running nextflow on an hpc, please specify your executor, and clusterOptions within the nextflow.config file. Please see https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html for more information regarding your executor. 2.6 Running NETISCE Once you have specified the parameters, run NETISCE using the following command: ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume ##or NETISCE_mutations.nf if including mutational data We recommend using the -resume flag in the case that you change a file or parameter within your pipeline. This way, nextflow caches results that remain unchanged, preventing pipeline steps from being re-run. 2.7 FVS_Finding Nextflow Script A user may be interested in identifying all FVSes within a network. By looking at individual FVSes, users can select the FVS that contains nodes of interest. We have included an additional Nextflow script that calculates the FVSes within a network and then provides the unique sets of FVSes identified. 2.7.1 parameters params.network = location of network file (this can be directed to your input_data folder) params.sets = number of FVS searches to perform (i.e., the randomseed value). This should be set reasonably high to discover all FVSes within a network, based on the network size. ##output FVSes.txt = file containing the unique minimal FVSes within the network. The first column contains the FVS identifier- the number following “FVS_” indicates which randomseed value was used to identify that specific FVS. You can use this value as the setting for params.randseed in NETISCE. "],["netisce-output.html", "3 NETISCE output", " 3 NETISCE output After the NETISCE computations are complete, the output files will be located in the results folder. Please note that we have included in this folder the most relevant output files that you may want to use for further analysis. However, you can explore all outputs by checking within each step of the pipeline’s work folder that is generated during a NETISCE run. The contents of each file are briefly described below. For more details and to see example outputs, please see the Toy Network Examples. exp_internalmarkers.txt This file contains the resultant steady state values for the internal marker nodes for the provided experimental samples (those specified in samples.txt) from Signal Flow Analysis. experimental_internalmarkers.png This png is a figure of the steady state values for the internal marker nodes for the provided experimental samples.

"],["toy.html", "4 Toy Network Examples 4.1 Overview 4.2 Data 4.3 NETISCE run configuration 4.4 Run NETISCE 4.5 NETSICE Results 4.6 Toy Example with mutations", " 4 Toy Network Examples Here, we will walk through a brief tutorial of a NETISCE run. The files necessary to complete the tutorial are within the input data folder of both NETISCE_local and NETISCE_hpc. The results from these Toy examples can be found in the toy_example_results folder of the main github repository. 4.1 Overview We will use a simple toy network of 6 nodes and 9 edges. Figure 4.1: Simple Toy Network 4.2 Data You can find the relevant data files in the input_data folder. In this example, we have 2 samples, A and B, with three replicates each (A_1,A_2,A_3, etc). The normalized expression data is housed in expressions.csv, and contains normalized expression values for the network nodes. Note that the value of F has been initialized to zero. A feature of NETISCE is that it does not require non-zero values for all network nodes, which is useful if the data is unavailable for a node. Such values can either be entered in the expressions.csv file as 0s, or the node can be excluded entirely from this file, depending on user preference (in this case, the values will automatically be initialized to 0). X A_1 A_2 A_3 B_1 B_2 B_3 A 2 1 2 6 7 6 B 6 7 6 2 1 1 C 5 5 5 1 1 1 D -1 -1 -2 6 7 6 E 2 1 2 6 7 6 F 0 0 0 0 0 0 The samples.txt file specifies that A is associated to a treatment sensitive phenotype, while B is associated to a resistance phenotype. sample_name phenotype A_1 sensitive A_2 sensitive A_3 sensitive B_1 resistant B_2 resistant B_3 resistant Note that you can use any term to describe the phenotypes. Just be sure to be consistent with the param.desried and param.undesired variables within the Nextflow .nf file. Lastly, we need to include a list of internal marker nodes. This list is in internal_marker.txt. For our small network, the internal-marker node is C. C 4.3 NETISCE run configuration With all your input data files loaded, next we configure the nextflow run in either NETISCE_local or NETSICE_hpc (Note: while we do recommend you run NETISCE on a hpc, this example is small enough to run locally). Open up NETISCE.nf. Here, you need to specify the parameters for the Nextflow run on lines 3-19. Please refer to section 2.5 for parameter definitions. For this example, your parameters should look like: params.expressions = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/expressions.csv&quot; params.network = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/network.sif&quot; params.samples = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/samples.txt&quot; params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal_marker.txt&quot; // params.mutations=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/mutations.csv&quot; params.alpha = 0.9 params.undesired = &#39;resistant&#39; params.desired = &#39;sensitive&#39; params.filter =&quot;strict&quot; params.kmeans_min_val = 2 params.kmeans_max_val = 10 params.num_nodes = 6 // that have expression data params.num_states = 100000 params.randseed=0 Some Notes: make sure to include $baseDir before pointing to the folder containing your input data. Also, be sure that params.num_nodes is the number of nodes where there exists data within expressions.csv. Finally, by adjusting the params.randseed you can identify alternate FVSes within the nextwork. 4.4 Run NETISCE In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the appropriate NETISCE folder (_hpc or local). To start your run, enter ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume. While NETISCE is running, your terminal should look like this, where you can see the progress on each step of the pipeline: Figure 4.2: Terminal when running NETISCE The first column contains the location (folder and subfolder) that is running that step of NETISCE within the work folder. Once the run has successfully completed, the process will end and the following will be displayed: Figure 4.3: Terminal when running NETISCE 4.5 NETSICE Results Let’s take a look at the results of our NETISCE run, where the goal was to shift the system from the undesired state B, and towards the desired state A. These results can be found in the toy_example_1 subfolder of the toy_example_results folder of the main github repository. exp_internalmarkers.txt Our internal marker node was node C. In this file we see the steady state values of node see in the A sample replicates A_1, A_2 and A_3 and B sample replicates B_1, B_2, and B_3 (as computed by SFA). name C A_1 0.792 A_2 0.844 A_3 0.800 B_1 0.232 B_2 0.171 B_3 0.166 experimental_internalmarkers.pdf The above numbers may be a little challenging to read! So, we have included a plot of the values in theexperimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 4.4: experimental marker node steady state values On this histogram, we see bars for each of the samples and their replicates. The A (sensitive) samples are marked by a blue vertical line at their steady state value, while the B (resistant) samples are marked by a red vertical line at their steady state value. The grey bars can be aggregated to show the number of attractors with values for C that are binned together (for example, in the above table we see that the steady state value of C in replicate B_2=0.171 and replicate B_3=0.166. These values are binned together on the histogram to show that two replicates had similar values.) Here, we see that the values of node C are well separated between the two phenotypes (all of the A values are greater than all of the B values). We will assume that this also aligns with the biological knowledge of the system. After estimating attractors for the experimental and randomly generated initial states, the resultant attractors were clustered using k-means clustering. The elbow and silhouette metrics are used to determine the optimal number k. elbow.png Figure 4.5: elbow metric for optimal k The elbow metric found the optimal number of k clusters to be k=3. silhouette.png Figure 4.6: silhouette metric for optimal k The silhouette metric found the optimal number of k clusters to be k=2. Since the optimal ks identified by the silhouette metric and the elbow metric do not match, NETISCE chooses the smaller k, as long as the phenotypes remain separate (NETISCE checks to make sure this is true). kmeans.txt The kmeans.txt file contains the clustering results for each attractor generated from the experimental data and the randomly generated initial states. The first column contains the sample name, and the second column contains the ID of which cluster it is assigned to. Since k=2 in this case, one cluster is named “0” and the other cluster is named “1” name clusters A_1 0 A_2 0 A_3 0 B_1 1 B_2 1 B_3 1 And we see in the kmeans.txt file, that the A samples are clustered in cluster 0, while the B samples are grouped in cluster 1. 4.5.0.1 FVS_Finding output of FVSes.txt The FVS_Finding Nextflow script was used to identify all unique FVSes in the toy network. V1 V2 V3 FVS_0 B E FVS_2 C D FVS_5 B D FVS_11 C E The first column contains the FVS identifier, where the number is the randomseed value where that FVS was identified. There were four FVSes identified in this network, each comprised of two nodes (column2 and column 3) fvs.txt We selected FVS_0 to be analyzed in this example. Therefore, params.randomseed was set to 0 name B E The FVS finding algorithm identified nodes B and E to be a minimal FVS control nodes in the toy network. Since the FVS control node set contained 2 nodes, 9 combinations of perturbations were performed on the control node sets. crit1perts.txt This file contains a list of IDs for the perturbations to FVS control nodes that passed criterion 1. V1 pert_3 pert_6 pert_8 3 out of the 9 pertrubations passed the machine learning filtering criterion. pert_replicate_1_internal_markers.txt NETISCE calculated perturbations on FVS control nodes when the system was initialized from the three undesired B replicates (B_1,B_2,B_3). The steady state values of the internal marker node C was extracted from each of these replicate perturbations that passed filtering criterion 1 (i.e., the steady state value of C in pert_3,pert_6, and pert_8). Here we will show the steady state values of C under FVS perturbations when the system was initialized with the normalized expression values of B_1 (contained in the file pert_replicate_1_internal_markers.txt; the values of C for the system under perturbations when initialized from B_2 are found in pert_replicate_2_internal_markers.txt, the values of C for the system under perturbations when initialized from B_3 are found in pert_replicate_3_internal_markers.txt ) name C pert_3 2.657829 pert_6 6.400000 pert_8 6.400000 successful_controlnode_perturbations.txt This file contains a table of the perturbations on FVS control nodes that passed both the 1st and 2nd filtering criteria. it also contains the number of upregulation,downregulations, and total number of nodes perturbed for each perturbation set. B E up down total pert_3 nochange down 0 1 1 pert_6 up down 1 1 2 pert_8 up up 2 0 2 Here, we see that four perturbations that passed both filtering criteria. Let’s take a quick look at the steady state values for these perturbations, and the attractors generated from the experimental data: name C A_1 0.792000 A_2 0.844000 A_3 0.800000 B_1 0.232000 B_2 0.171000 B_3 0.166000 pert_3 2.657829 pert_6 6.400000 pert_8 6.400000 Indeed, we see that the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated by peturbations to the FVS control nodes are all are greater than the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated from the sensitive A sample. A successful reprogramming from resistant (B) to sensitive (A) cells has occurred! 4.6 Toy Example with mutations Let’s say that in our system, gene D exhibits a gain of function mutation in the sensitive phenotype (A samples). If we want to include this in our simulations, we will use the NETISCE_mutations.nf pipeline. First, we must add to our input_data folder a .csv file containing the mutational profile. Let’s call this file mutations.csv: X D A_1 1 A_2 1 A_3 1 B_1 NA B_2 NA B_3 NA The gain of function mutation is encoded with 1 (loss-of-function mutations can be encoded with “0”). Next, we make sure that the parameters in NETISCE_mutations.nf on lines 3-19 are set correctly for the conditions For this example, your parameters should look like: params.expressions = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/expressions.csv&quot; params.network = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/network.sif&quot; params.samples = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/samples.txt&quot; params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal_marker.txt&quot; params.mutations=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/mutations.csv&quot; params.alpha = 0.9 params.undesired = &#39;resistant&#39; params.desired = &#39;sensitive&#39; params.filter =&quot;strict&quot; params.kmeans_min_val = 2 params.kmeans_max_val = 10 params.num_nodes = 4 // that have expression data params.num_states = 1000 Note, the additional parameter params.mutations that points to the mutations.csv. As above, to run Netisce, enter ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume. Results By including mutational information, the results of NETISCE have changed.These results can be found in the toy_example_2 subfolder of the toy_example_results folder of the main github repository. Now, our successful_controlnode_perturbations.txt file contains pert_7 in addition to perturbations pert_3, pert_6, and pert_8 B E up down total pert_3 nochange down 0 1 1 pert_7 up nochange 1 0 1 pert_6 up down 1 1 2 pert_8 up up 2 0 2 Let’s take a look at the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated from the successful perturbations and the experimental initial states B_1 when mutational information is included. name C pert_3 2.319659 pert_6 6.400000 pert_7 6.400000 pert_8 6.400000 Though the values are different in this system with mutations, we still see that the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated by peturbations to the FVS control nodes are all are greater than the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated from the sensitive A sample. A successful reprogramming from resistant (B) to sensitive (A) cells has occurred!

You can read the original report here: link The original studies of Cell Fate Specification in the Ascidian Embryo were performed by Kobayashi et al. in “Using linkage logic theory to control dynamics of a gene regulatory network of a chordate embryo (Sci Rep 11, 4001 (2021))”. The network, internal-marker nodes, and FVS was derived from the publication and its supplementary material. The input data, nextflow pipeline, and results of this simulation can be found in the ascidian embryo folder in the github repository These simulations were run on a high performance cluster that uses a SLURM executor. Although we recommend that you run NETISCE on an hpc, this simulation is small enough that it can be run on a local machine. If you choose to run it locally, then remove the nextflow.config file from the directory. 5.1 Input Data The goal of this simulation was to reproduce the results of experimental perturbations to the FVS nodes of the cell fate specification GRN for ascidian embryos using Signal Flow Analysis. Therefore, we use a modified version of the NETISCE pipeline to simulate these specific perturbations. We are only interested in performing the 7 perturbations to the 6 FVS control nodes that were experimentally verified to induce cell tissue fates. network.sifcontains the gene regulatory network of ascidian embryonic development. expression.csv contains the initial activities for the unperturbed state and the 7 FVS control node perturbations. Here, all simulations have Gata.a and Zic-r.a=1, as the activation of these two genes is required for normal embryonic development. perturbations.csv contains the specified perturbations for each FVS node in the appropriate perturbation simulation. 0 denotes downregulation, wherease 1 encodes upregulation. If no value is set, then there is no fixed perturbation to the FVS node, as in the unperturbed case. internal-marker-nodes.txt contains the 7 internal marker nodes used to verify if the specified cell reprogramming had been successfully simulated. 5.2 Run the simulation To run the simulation, simply execute the ascidian-embryo.nf file using the following command: ./nextflow run ascidian-embryo.nf -resume 5.3 Results The nextflow pipeline generates 1 result file exp_internalmarkers.txt, which contains the steady state values of the internal-marker nodes for the unperturbed attractor, and the attractors generated from the perturbations on FVS control nodes. name Alp Bco Celf3.a Epi1 Fli.Erg.a Myl Noto1 unperturbed -0.0000341 0.0018729 0.0018729 0.0217995 0.0013966 0.0008975 0.0004029 Adentz (Endoderm perturbation) 0.1179951 -0.4252100 -0.4252100 0.2707276 -0.1836794 -0.1396049 0.1169769 adentZ (brain+pan-neural perturbation) -0.3845691 0.4252100 0.4252100 0.2707276 -0.2370737 -0.0041647 0.1123776 adeNtz (pan-neural perturbation) -0.5243074 -0.4252100 -0.4252100 0.2707276 -0.3002010 -0.1063952 0.2408746 adEntZ (mesenchyme perturbation) -0.2630083 0.4252100 0.4252100 -0.1563935 0.2841288 -0.0871440 -0.0052551 adentz (epidermis perturbation) -0.5243074 -0.4252100 -0.4252100 0.2707276 -0.3002010 -0.1237829 0.2349825 adenTz (muscle perturbation) -0.5243074 -0.4252100 -0.4252100 0.2707276 -0.3002010 0.0837375 0.2589035 aDentz (notochord perturbation) -0.3792942 -0.4252100 -0.4252100 0.1988199 -0.3966199 -0.1218621 0.0943055 A perturbation is considered successful if the internal-marker node in the attractor generated from the perturbed FVS control nodes has a larger steady-state value than that in the unperturbed attractor.

This can help us identify which perturbations successfully induced the appropriate tissue fate. The following code for generating radar plots was adapted from datanovia.com.

The goal of these simulations is to identify targets that can reprogram cells from the Epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) fate towards the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) fate. You can read the original report here: link The original study of reversion of primed pluripotency in mouse epiblast stem cells was performed by Yachie-Kinoshita et al. in “Modeling signaling-dependent pluripotency with Boolean logic to predict cell fate transitions (Molecular Systems Biology (2018)14:e7952)”. The network and internal-marker nodes were extracted from the publication and its supplementary material. The normalized expression data used for initial activities in NETISCE can be found at GSE62155. The input data, nextflow pipeline, and results of this simulation can be found in the ipsc folder in the NETISCE github repository 6.1 Input Data network.sif contains the network structure for pluripotent stem cell signaling expression.csv contains the initial activities for ESC cells (3 replicates), and EpiSC cells (3 replicates) internal-marker-kinoshita.txt contains the 4 internal marker nodes that were originally used in Yachie-Kinoshita et al., to evaluate simulations. internal-marker-kinoshita-expanded.txt contains the 4 internal marker nodes that were originally used in Yachie-Kinoshita et al., plus the additional marker ndoes identified from the data used to evaluate simulations. samples.txt contains they key for NETISCE to associate certain samples to the phenotypes of Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) or Epiblast Stem Cells (EpiSCs) 6.2 Run the simulation These simulations were run on a high performance cluster that uses a SLURM executor. If your hpc uses a different executor, please update those specifications in the nextflow.config file in the directory. Please see https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html for more information regarding your executor. For ease of reproduction, we have included all files necessary to reproduce the reported results directly in the directory. We do recommend you run this simulation on an hpc. We have included the bash file we used on our SLURM executor. Note: within the NETISCE.nf configuration file, we have included two lines for specifying the internal-marker nodes: #!/usr/bin/env nextflow params.expressions = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/expression.csv&quot; params.network = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/network.sif&quot; params.samples = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/samples.txt&quot; params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal-marker-kinoshita.txt&quot; // params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal-marker-kinoshita-expanded.txt&quot; params.alpha = 0.9 params.undesired = &#39;EpiSC&#39; params.desired = &#39;ESC&#39; params.filter =&quot;strict&quot; As discussed in our paper, we filtered the perturbations using the original 4 internal-marker nodes for pluripotency (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, EpiTFs), and then again using 3 additional internal-marker nodes. Therefore, to run either analysis, comment/uncomment the internal-marker node file you are interested in. If you want to run NETISCE first with the original internal-marker nodes, make sure to change the results file names for exp_internalmarkers.txt,successful_controlnode_perturubations.txt, and original-experimental_internalmarkers.pdf as to not overwrite them (or move them into a separate folder). Additionally, when you run the nextflow command, please be sure to use the -resume flag so that you use the cached computations that do not need to be re-computed You can also run NETISCE directly using the following command: ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume 6.3 Results Herein, we will focus on the results that are deposited in the results folder by NETISCE. However, each step of the nextflow pipeline produces its corresponding raw results (for example, the entire attractor state for network simulations initialized with experimental data). If you are interested in looking at those raw results, they can be found within the work folder. We provide workfiles.txt which is a guide to which folders/subfolders contain the relevant results of each step. 6.3.1 General Results First, let’s take a look at the results that do not depend on the internal-marker node set. FVS finding The FVS solving algorithm identified one FVS, containing 6 nodes. name Sox2 Nanog Gata6 Tbx3 Oct4 Klf4 Attractor landscape estimation via k-means analysis Now, let’s look at the results of k-means analysis. First, NETISCE determines the optimal number of k clusters by computing the elbow and silhouette metrics. Figure 6.1: optimal k as identified by a) the elbow and b) silhouette metrics We see that the optimal k assessed by the elbow metric was k=4, while the optimal k identified by the silhouette metric was k=2. NETISCE automatically chooses the smaller k value, after checking that the attractors generated from the ESC samples and EpiSC samples do not appear in the same cluster. k=2 was selected for k-means optimal k, and we can see that the attractors generated from the ESC samples and EpiSC samples do not appear in separate clusters. name clusters ESC_1 0 ESC_2 0 ESC_3 0 EpiSC_1 1 EpiSC_2 1 EpiSC_3 1 Pertrubations on FVS control nodes that pass criterion 1 With 6 FVS control nodes, NETISCE performed 729 simulations of combinations of perturbations on the FVS control nodes. The resulting attractors were classified to the clusters produced from the k-means analysis using Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Machine Learning classification algorithms. Then, the perturbations are filtered by which of their corresponding attractors were classified to the ESC cluster by at least 2 of the 3 methods. These results can be found in crit1_perts.txt. Here we show the first 10 rows. ## [1] &quot;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 1: 375&quot; x pert_8 pert_17 pert_26 pert_35 pert_44 pert_53 pert_88 pert_89 pert_97 pert_98 6.3.2 Results using 4 internal-marker nodes The relevant files have the prefix ‘original’ in the github repository Our second perturbation filtering criterion identifies perturbations where, in their corresponding attractors, 90% of the steady state values for internal-marker nodes that are within the steady state expression ranges in the attractors generated from the ESC experimental data. First, let’s take a look at the steady state values of the internal-marker nodes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog in the attractors generated from the ESC and EpiSC experimental data. The values can be found in the original-exp_internalmarkers.txt and are plotted in original-experimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 6.2: histograms of 4 internal-marker node values We see that the values of the internal-markers for the pluripotent state (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog) are higher in the attractors generated from the experimental data of the ESCs than the attractors generated from the experimental data of the EpiSCs, and the makrer of the epiblast stem state is higher in the attractors generated from the experimental data of the EpiSCs than in the attractors generated from the experimental data of the ESC. Now, we can take a look at the attractors that passed filtering criterion 2. We show the first 10 rows here, but you can view the entire set in original-successful_controlnode_perturbations.txt crit2_4&lt;-read.delim(&#39;ipsc/results/original-successful_controlnode_perturbations.txt&#39;,sep=&quot; &quot;,as.is = T) print(paste0(&#39;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 2: &#39;,nrow(crit2_4))) ## [1] &quot;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 2: 132&quot; knitr::kable(crit2_4[1:10,]) %&gt;% column_spec(8, bold = F, border_left = T) %&gt;% scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, box_css = &quot;border: 0px;&quot;) Sox2 Nanog Gata6 Tbx3 Oct4 Klf4 up down total pert_445 nochange up nochange nochange nochange nochange 1 0 1 pert_607 up nochange nochange nochange nochange nochange 1 0 1 pert_368 nochange nochange nochange nochange up up 2 0 2 pert_418 nochange up down nochange nochange nochange 1 1 2 pert_436 nochange up nochange down nochange nochange 1 1 2 pert_446 nochange up nochange nochange nochange up 2 0 2 pert_448 nochange up nochange nochange up nochange 2 0 2 pert_454 nochange up nochange up nochange nochange 2 0 2 pert_580 up nochange down nochange nochange nochange 1 1 2 pert_598 up nochange nochange down nochange nochange 1 1 2 We can look to see if there are any trends in the orientation of the perturbations on FVS control nodes across the perturbations that passed both filtering criteria. library(data.table) library(ggplot2) d3&lt;-crit2_4 [,c(1:6)] %&gt;% transpose() %&gt;% as.matrix() row.names(d3)&lt;-colnames(crit2_4[1:6]) colnames(d3)&lt;-row.names(crit2_4) d3r&lt;-reshape2::melt(d3) %&gt;% select(-Var2) #From Paul Tol: https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/ Tol_muted &lt;- c(&#39;#88CCEE&#39;, &#39;#44AA99&#39;, &#39;#117733&#39;, &#39;#332288&#39;, &#39;#DDCC77&#39;, &#39;#999933&#39;,&#39;#CC6677&#39;, &#39;#882255&#39;, &#39;#AA4499&#39;, &#39;#DDDDDD&#39;) ggplot(d3r, aes(x=value)) + facet_wrap(~Var1,scales = &quot;free_x&quot;,shrink=FALSE) + geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/ncol(d3),fill=value)) + scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + scale_fill_manual(values=Tol_muted)+ ylab(&quot;% of specified perturbation to an FVS control node across all \\n combinations of perturbations that passed filtering criteria &quot;) + xlab(&quot;node perturbation&quot;) Here, we see that in the majority of perturbations, there is overexpression of the FVS nodes Sox2, Nanog and Oct4. This aligns with their role as maintainers of pluripotency. The steady-state values of the internal-marker nodes for these perturbations can be found in pert1_internal_markers.txt. A perturbation on the FVS control node, Nanog overexpression (pert_445), was also identified in Yachie-Kinoshita et al. and experimentally verified to shift cells from the EpiSC state towards the ESC state. We can plot the internal-marker node values using a radar plot. We can also plot Klf4 overexpression. This was a perturbation identified by Yachie-Kinoshita et al. to shift cells from the EpiSC state towards the ESC state. However, in our analyses, this perturbation (pert_365), did pass filtering criterion 1, but did not pass filtering criterion 2. library(fmsb) attr_pert&lt;-read.delim(&quot;ipsc/results/pert1_internal_markers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) attr_pert &lt;-attr_pert[c(&#39;pert_445&#39;,&#39;pert_365&#39;),c(&#39;Oct4&#39;,&quot;Sox2&quot;,&quot;Nanog&quot;,&quot;EpiTFs&quot;)] exp&lt;-read.delim(&quot;ipsc/results/original-exp_internalmarkers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) EpiSC_avg&lt;-colMeans(exp[4:6,]) ESC_avg&lt;-colMeans(exp[1:3,]) d1&lt;-rbind(EpiSC_avg,ESC_avg,attr_pert) rownames(d1)[1:4]&lt;- c(&quot;EpiSC&quot;, &quot;ESC&quot;,&quot;Nanog overexpression&quot;,&quot;Klf4 overexpression&quot;) maxcol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, max) mincol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, min) d2&lt;-rbind(maxcol,mincol, d1) rownames(d2)[1:2]&lt;- c(&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Min&quot;) par(mar = c(4, 0.1, 4, 0.1)) for (i in 5:nrow(d2)) { create_beautiful_radarchart(d2[c(1:4, i), ],color = c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;),caxislabels = seq(round(min(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),round(max(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),.2),title =row.names(d2)[i]);legend(x=0.4, y=1.4, legend =c(&quot;average EpiSC&quot;,&quot;average ESC&quot;,row.names(d2)[i]) , bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch=20 , col=c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;) , text.col = &quot;black&quot;, cex=1, pt.cex=2) } Figure 6.3: radar charts of the steady-state values of 4 internal-marker nodes for Nanog overexpression and Klf4 overexpression perturbation We see here, indeed that the values for Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, (when considered these three genes as internal-marker nodes) and EpiTFs are within the expected range for Nanog overexpression, but the values of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog in the attractor generated from Klf4 overexpression do not reach the values of the ESC state. 6.3.3 Results using 7 internal-marker nodes The relevant files have the prefix ‘expanded’ in the github repository. We explored filtering the 132 perturbations that passed the second filtering criterion by adding additional internal-marker nodes associated with pluripotency. We added 3 nodes, Lefty1, Pitx2 (transcription factors active in EpiSCs), and Esrrb (transcription factor active in ESCs) to the 4 previously used internal-marker nodes. Let’s look at the steady state values of the internal-marker nodes in the attractors generated from the ESC and EpiSC experimental data. The values can be found in the expanded-exp_internalmarkers.txt and are plotted in expanded-experimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 6.4: histograms of 7 internal-marker node values Again, the internal-marker nodes have the correct expression patterns within the attractors generated from the ESC and EpiSC states.

First, NETISCE determines the optimal number of k clusters by computing the elbow and silhouette metrics. Figure 7.1: optimal k as identified by a) the elbow and b) silhouette metrics We see that the optimal k assessed by both the elbow metric and silhouette metric was k=3. NETISCE checkes to make sure that the untreated, MAPK inihibitor therapy resistant, and MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitive attractors are all separate. We can look at those results in the kmeans.txt file. name clusters HT29 0 HT29_BRAFiEGFRi 2 HT29_BRAFi 1 Pertrubations on FVS control nodes that pass criterion 1 With 13 FVS control nodes, NETISCE performed 1,594,323 simulations of combinations of perturbations on the FVS control nodes. The resulting attractors were classified to the clusters produced from the k-means analysis using Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Machine Learning classification algorithms. Then, the perturbations are filtered by which of their corresponding attractors were classified to the MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitive cluster by at least 2 of the 3 methods. These results can be found in crit1_perts.txt. Here we show the first 10 rows. ## [1] &quot;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 1: 232114&quot; x pert_0 pert_1 pert_2 pert_9 pert_10 pert_11 pert_18 pert_19 pert_20 pert_27 7.3.2 Results using 3 internal-marker nodes The relevant files have the prefix ‘original’ in the github repository Our second perturbation filtering criterion identifies perturbations where, in their corresponding attractors, 90% of the steady state values for internal-marker nodes that are within the steady state expression ranges in the attractor representing MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitivity. First, let’s take a look at the steady state values of the internal-marker nodes CASP3, CCNE1, and MAPK1 in the attractors generated from the untreated HT29 with simulated BRAFi (resistant) and BRAFi+EGFRi (sensitive). The values can be found in the exp_internalmarkers.txt and are plotted in -experimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 7.2: histograms of 3 internal-marker node values We see that the value of the internal-marker for the apoptosis (CASP3) is higher and the steady-state values of the internal-marker nodes for proliferation (CCNE1) and MAPK signaling (MAPK1) are lower in the MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitive associated attractor than the MAPK inhibitor therapy resistance and untreated associated attractors.

The individual results for all three sets can be found in their respective folders on github: apoptosis-marker-nodes mapk-marker-nodes proliferation-marker-nodes We are interested in perturbations on FVS control nodes that pass the filtering criterion for each of the three phenotypes (i.e., the 90% threshold for steady-state values is met separately for each of the sets of apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and proliferation nodes).

In the majority of of perturbations, TSC1 is upregulated, and GRB2 is downregulated. The two smallest sets of perturbations that passed the filtering criteria were BRAFi+SRCi+TSC1overexpression (pert_797159) and BRAFi+SRCi+GRB2i (pert_790597).

We evaluated this metric in the von Dassow ODE model of Drosophila Segment Polarity Genes and the Zhou model of pancreatic cell fate differentiation. The original study of controlling Drosophila development using the FVS Control theory was performed by Zanudo et al. inStructure-based control of complex networks with nonlinear dynamics using the von Dassow Segment Polarity genes ODE model, originally published in The segment polarity network is a robust developmental module.. The ODE model was obtained form xyz, and the initial states were extracted from the supplementary material of Zanudo et al.. The study of pancreatic cell fate differentiation was performed by Zhou et al. in “Predicting Pancreas Cell Fate Decisions and Reprogramming with a Hierarchical Multi-Attractor Model”. The model and parameters were extracted from Zhou et al. The input data, COPASI files, nextflow pipeline, and results of this simulation can be found in the noise_studies folder in the NETISCE github repository. Our approach to these noise studies uses COPASI to simulate two differential equation models of cell reprogramming and add different noise levels into some initial states. We use these generated initial states to simulate 1,000 triplicates of the desired and undesired phenotype normalized gene expression data per noise level varying from 0% to 50% 8.1 COPASI simualtions of mathematical models In COPASI, we simulated the Differential Equation (DE) DE models using the Time Course function for the undesired and desired phenotypes. We additionally simulate the time course for the undesired initial condition when a perturbation on FVS nodes is applied to ensure the system still arrives at the desired attractor. We injected seven levels of noise (1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) in the undesired and desired initial conditions using the Random Distribution item in the COPASI’s Parameter Scan function. For each node with a nonzero initial concentration, the noisy initial condition was generated using a normal distribution, where the mean was the initial state of the node, and the standard deviation was .1, .5, .10, .20, .30, .40, or .50, to simulate 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% noise, respectively. We generated 1,000 initial states for each noise level for the desired initial and undesired initial states. 8.1.1 von Dassow’s Drosophila Segment Polarity Gene model In COPASI, von Dassow’s Drosophila Segment Polarity Gene model simulations were computed using the deterministic LSODA Solver for 500 seconds when a steady-state was reached. The COPASI file containing the model, parameters, and Time Course functions for both the wild type and unpatterned initial states can be found in https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/tree/main/noise_studies/drosophila/copasi. 8.1.2 Zhou Cell Fate Specification model The SDE model was extracted from Zhou et al. and simulated using the SDE solver. To implement the time-delay perturbations of MafA, Pdx1, Ngn3, Pax4 overexpression, and Ptf1a knockout in exocrine cells, we used the Event function to increase the production or degradation rates as performed in Zhou et al. he COPASI file containing the model, parameters, and Time Course functions can be found in https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/tree/main/noise_studies/pancreas/copasi. 8.2 Noisy initial states files The above COPASI files automatically export the initial states of the network nodes with noise to a csv file (found in https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/tree/main/noise_studies/drosophila/noise-initial-states or https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/blob/main/noise_studies/pancreas/noise-initial-states/expressions-10percent.csv). The generate_triplicates.py script can split the generated initial states into separate files, each containing 3 undesired and 3 desired initial states. You can find examples in the pancreas and (drosophila)[https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/tree/main/noise_studies/drosophila/NETISCE/40-percentnoise/input_data/noise] subfolders. 8.3 Running the NETISCE simulations Due to space constraints on github, we have provided the entire folder for one level of noise for the Drosophila and Pancreas examples. 8.3.1 Drosophila noise studies at 40% noise in initial states The relevant input files and nextflorw pipeline can be found in https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/tree/main/noise_studies/drosophila/NETISCE/40-percentnoise. We provide the shell script which will loop through all initial states files to run NETISCE for each set of wild type and unpatterened initial states. If you are interested in running this analysis with a different noise level, you can use the generate_triplicates.py to create triplicates of initial states from the appropriate noisy initial states. Then, in the run.sh shell script, set the --expressions flag to the directory that contains your noisy initial states. 8.3.2 Pancreas cell fate specification at 10% noise in initial states The relevant input files and nextflorw pipeline can be found in https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/tree/main/noise_studies/pancreas/NETISCE/10percent/input_data.
