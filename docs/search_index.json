Cell-fate reprogramming is a powerful type of cellular reprogramming which aims to drive a system from a selected initial state towards a desired phenotype. However, methods for identifying reprogramming targets remain limited in biological systems that lack large sets of experimental data or dynamical characterization. We present here NETISCE, a novel computational method for identifying cell-fate reprogramming targets and their perturbations in static networks through the application of control theory and dynamical systems frameworks to a network-based analysis. Our method only requires a static network and the gene expression data for the initial state of the system. We validate NETISCE in studies of cell-fate reprogramming from developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology. Our results show that NETISCE can predict previously identified cell-fate reprogramming target perturbations in these systems, and identify potentially novel combinations of targets. This work extends cell-fate reprogramming studies beyond fully parameterized models and can be used by experimental and computational biologists to guide their cell-fate reprogramming studies. For more information, please see the accompanying paper: link here This manual contains instructions for installing the NETISCE pipeline tool and accessing the Galaxy Project GUI web-based tool. We provide a simple toy example walkthrough tutorial. Lastly, we include instructions for reproducing NETISCE cell reprogramming results in developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology.

However, we provide two Nextflow pipelines, one designed for hpcs (NETISCE_hpc), and another for running NETISCE on a local machine (NETISCE_local). 2.2 Install Nextflow Nextflow is required to run the NETISCE pipeline. Please follow the instructions from https://www.nextflow.io/ (see ‘Getting Started’ steps 1 &amp; 2) to install Nextflow in the appropriate NETSICE folder (_local or _hpc). 2.3 Docker Image docker image provided here TBD 2.4 Prerequisuites If you are not using the Docker image, the following packages will need to be installed: scipy pandas sklearn yellowbrick 2.5 Parameters and Configuration Whether on your local machine or hpc, to run NETISCE you must specify the files and parameters within the .nf file params.expressions: csv file containing normalized expression data for network nodes in different samples params.network: network file (sif format) params.samples: text file specifying the phenotype for each sample in params.expressions file (tab delimited) params.internal_control: text file containing a list of nodes to be used as internal marker nodes params.alpha: alpha parameter for signal flow analysis (default =0.9) params.undesired: string of the undesired phenotype (as labeled in the params.samples file) params.desired: string of the desired phenotype (as labeled in the params.samples file) params.filter: filtering parameter for criterion 2 (“strict” or “relaxed”) params.kmeans_min_val: minimum k-means value for clustering (default=2) params.kmeans_max_val: maximum k-means value for clustering (default=10) params.num_nodes: number of nodes in network for which normalized expression data exists (within the params.expressions file) params.num_states: number of randomly generated initial states (default=100000, or 3^n where n is the number of network nodes and 3^n is less than 100000) Please see the input_data folder for examples of files to match the formatting. 2.5.1 NETISCE_mutations.nf If you are interested in including mutational information, please use the NETISCE_mutations.nf pipeline. You must additionally specify params.mutations: a csv file containing mutational configuration for network nodes (0 for loss of function, 1 for gain of function). Please see example in input_data for formatting. 2.5.2 nextflow.config If you are running nextflow on an hpc, please specify your executor, and clusterOptions within the nextflow.config file. Please see https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html for more information regarding your executor. 2.6 Running NETISCE Once you have specified the parameters, run NETSICE using the following command: ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume ##or NETISCE_mutations.nf if including mutational data We recommend using the -resume flag in the case that you change a file or parameter within your pipeline. This way, nextflow caches results that remain unchanged, preventing pipeline steps from being re-run.

The files necessary to complete the tutorial are within the input data folder of both NETISCE_local and NETISCE_hpc. The results from these Toy examples can be found in the toy_example_results folder of the main github repository. 4.1 Overview We will use a simple toy network of 6 nodes and 9 edges. Figure 4.1: Simple Toy Network 4.2 Data You can find the relevant data files in the input_data folder. In this example, we have 2 samples, A and B, with three replicates each (A_1,A_2,A_3, etc). The normalized expression data is housed in expressions.csv, and contains normalized expression values for 4 of the network nodes (in this case, node C was not found to be expressed in the samples). X A_1 A_2 A_3 B_1 B_2 B_3 A 2 1 2 6 7 6 B 6 7 6 2 1 1 D -1 -1 -2 6 7 6 E 2 1 2 6 7 6 The samples.txt file specifies that A is associated to a treatment sensitive phenotype, while B is associated to a resistance phenotype. name phenotype A_1 sensitive A_2 sensitive A_3 sensitive B_1 resistant B_2 resistant B_3 resistant Note that you can use any term to describe the phenotypes. Just be sure to be consistent with the param.desried and param.undesired variables within the Nextflow .nf file. Lastly, we need to include a list of internal marker nodes. This list is in internal_marker.txt. For our small network, the internal-marker node is C. C 4.3 NETISCE run configuration With all your input data files loaded, next we configure the nextflow run in either NETISCE_local or NETSICE_hpc (Note: while we do recommend you run NETISCE on a hpc, this example is small enough to run locally). Open up NETISCE.nf. Here, you need to specify the parameters for the Nextflow run on lines 3-19. Please refer to section 2.5 for parameter definitions. For this example, your parameters should look like: params.expressions = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/expressions.csv&quot; params.network = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/network.sif&quot; params.samples = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/samples.txt&quot; params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal_marker.txt&quot; params.alpha = 0.9 params.undesired = &#39;resistant&#39; params.desired = &#39;sensitive&#39; params.filter =&quot;strict&quot; params.kmeans_min_val = 2 params.kmeans_max_val = 10 params.num_nodes = 4 // that have expression data params.num_states = 100000 Some Notes: make sure to include $baseDir before pointing to the folder containing your input data. Also, be sure that params.num_nodes is the number of nodes where there exists normalized expression data within expression.csv. 4.4 Run NETISCE In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the appropriate NETISCE folder (_hpc or local). To start your run, enter ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume. While NETISCE is running, your terminal should look like this, where you can see the progress on each step of the pipeline: Figure 4.2: Terminal when running NETISCE The first column contains the location (folder and subfolder) that is running that step of NETISCE within the work folder. Once the run has successfully completed, the process will end and the following will be displayed: Figure 4.3: Terminal when running NETISCE 4.5 NETSICE Results Let’s take a look at the results of our NETISCE run, where the goal was to shift the system from the undesired state B, and towards the desired state A. These results can be found in the toy_example_1 subfolder of the toy_example_results folder of the main github repository. exp_internalmarkers.txt Our internal marker node was node C. In this file we see the steady state values of the node in the A and B sample replicates (the output values from SFA). name C A_1 0.4278056 A_2 0.4802943 A_3 0.4361991 B_1 0.1590962 B_2 0.0982107 B_3 0.0935476 experimental_internalmarkers.pdf The above numbers may be a little challenging to read! So, we have included a plot of the values in theexperimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 4.4: experimental marker node steady state values On this histogram, we see bars for each of the samples and their replicates. The A (sensitive) samples are marked by a blue vertical line at their steady state value, while the B (resistant) samples are marked by a red vertical line at their steady state value. Here, we see that the values of node C are well separated between the two phenotypes (all of the A values are greater than all of the B values). We will assume that this also aligns with the biological knowledge of the system. In this example, since there are only 4 network nodes that have normalized expression values, NETISCE generates the maximum number of random initial states, \\(3^4\\), or 81. After estimating attractors for the experimental and randomly generated initial states, the resultant attractors were clustered using k-means clustering. The elbow and silhouette metrics are used to determine the optimal number k. elbow.png Figure 4.5: elbow metric for optimal k The elbow metric found the optimal number of k clusters to be k=3. silhouette.png Figure 4.6: silhouette metric for optimal k The silhouette metric found the optimal number of k clusters to be k=2. Since the optimal ks identified by the silhouette metric and the elbow metric do not match, NETISCE chooses the smaller k, as long as the phenotypes remain separate (NETISCE checks to make sure this is true). kmeans.txt The kmeans.txt file contains the clustering results for each attractor generated from the experimental data and the randomly generated initial states. The first column contains the sample name, and the second column contains the ID of which cluster it is assigned to. Since k=2 in this case, one cluster is named “0” and the other cluster is named “1” name clusters A_1 0 A_2 0 A_3 0 B_1 1 B_2 1 B_3 1 And we see in the kmeans.txt file, that the A samples are clustered in cluster 0, while the B samples are grouped in cluster 1. fvs.txt This file contains the node names that were identified by the FVS finding algorithm. name D B The FVS finding algorithm identified nodes B and D to be the minimal FVS control nodes in the toy network. Since the FVS control node set contained 2 nodes, 9 combinations of perturbations were performed on the control node sets. crit1perts.txt This file contains a list of IDs for the perturbations to FVS control nodes that passed criterion 1. V1 pert_0 pert_1 pert_2 pert_4 pert_5 pert_6 pert_7 pert_8 8 out of the 9 pertrubations passed the machine learning filtering criterion. pert1_internal_markers.txt This file contains a table of the internal marker node state values from control node perturbations whose associated attractors passed the first filtering criterion. name C pert_0 -2.7000000 pert_1 1.0209997 pert_2 6.3000000 pert_4 -0.0427445 pert_5 6.3000000 pert_6 -2.7000000 pert_7 -2.8528056 pert_8 6.3000000 successful_controlnode_perturbations.txt This file contains a table of the perturbations on FVS control nodes that passed both the 1st and 2nd filtering criteria. it also contains the number of upregulation,downregulations, and total number of nodes perturbed for each perturbation set. D B up down total pert_1 down nochange 0 1 1 pert_5 nochange up 1 0 1 pert_2 down up 1 1 2 pert_8 up up 2 0 2 Here, we see that four perturbations that passed both filtering criteria. Let’s take a quick look at the steady state values for these perturbations, and the attractors generated from the experimental data: name C 1 A_1 0.4278056 2 A_2 0.4802943 3 A_3 0.4361991 4 B_1 0.1590962 5 B_2 0.0982107 6 B_3 0.0935476 21 pert_1 1.0209997 31 pert_2 6.3000000 51 pert_5 6.3000000 8 pert_8 6.3000000 Indeed, we see that the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated by peturbations to the FVS control nodes are all are greater than the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated from the sensitive A sample. A successful reprogramming from resistant (B) to sensitive (A) cells has occurred! 4.6 Toy Example with mutations Let’s say that in our system, gene A exhibits a loss of function mutation in the sensitive phenotype (A samples). If we want to include this in our simulations, we will use the NETISCE_mutations.nf pipeline. First, we must add to our input_data folder a .csv file containing the mutational profile. Let’s call this file mutations.csv: X A A_1 0 A_2 0 A_3 0 B_1 NA B_2 NA B_3 NA The loss of function mutation is encoded with 0 (gain-of-function mutations can be encoded with “1”). Next, we make sure that the parameters in NETISCE_mutations.nf on lines 3-19 are set correctly for the conditions For this example, your parameters should look like: params.expressions = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/expressions.csv&quot; params.network = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/network.sif&quot; params.samples = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/samples.txt&quot; params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal_marker.txt&quot; params.mutations=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/mutations.csv&quot; params.alpha = 0.9 params.undesired = &#39;resistant&#39; params.desired = &#39;sensitive&#39; params.filter =&quot;strict&quot; params.kmeans_min_val = 2 params.kmeans_max_val = 10 params.num_nodes = 4 // that have expression data params.num_states = 1000 Note, the additional parameter params.mutations that points to the mutations.csv. As above, to run Netisce, enter ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume. Results By including mutational information, the results of NETISCE have changed.These results can be found in the toy_example_2 subfolder of the toy_example_results folder of the main github repository. Now, our successful_controlnode_perturbations.txt file contains pert_0 instead of pert_8 B D up down total pert_1 down nochange 0 1 1 pert_5 nochange up 1 0 1 pert_0 down down 0 2 2 pert_2 down up 1 1 2 Let’s take a look at the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated from the successful perturbations and the experimental initial states when mutational information is included. name C A_1 -0.6621166 B_1 0.1590962 pert_0 -2.7000000 pert_1 -2.7000000 pert_2 -2.7000000 pert_5 -2.8528056 Though the values are different in this system with mutations, we still see that the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated by peturbations to the FVS control nodes are all are greater than the steady-state expression values of node C in the attractors generated from the sensitive A sample. A successful reprogramming from resistant (B) to sensitive (A) cells has occurred!

If your hpc uses a different executor, please update those specifications in the nextflow.config file in the directory. Please see https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html for more information regarding your executor. For ease of reproduction, we have included all files necessary to reproduce the reported results directly in the directory. We do recommend you run this simulation on an hpc. We have included the bash file we used on our SLURM executor. Note: within the NETISCE.nf configuration file, we have included two lines for specifying the internal-marker nodes: #!/usr/bin/env nextflow params.expressions = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/expression.csv&quot; params.network = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/network.sif&quot; params.samples = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/samples.txt&quot; params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal-marker-kinoshita.txt&quot; // params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal-marker-kinoshita-expanded.txt&quot; params.alpha = 0.9 params.undesired = &#39;EpiSC&#39; params.desired = &#39;ESC&#39; params.filter =&quot;strict&quot; As discussed in our paper, we filtered the perturbations using the original 4 internal-marker nodes for pluripotency (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, EpiTFs), and then again using 3 additional internal-marker nodes. Therefore, to run either analysis, comment/uncomment the internal-marker node file you are interested in. If you want to run NETISCE first with the original internal-marker nodes, make sure to change the results file names for exp_internalmarkers.txt,successful_controlnode_perturubations.txt, and original-experimental_internalmarkers.pdf as to not overwrite them (or move them into a separate folder). Additionally, when you run the nextflow command, please be sure to use the -resume flag so that you use the cached computations that do not need to be re-computed You can also run NETISCE directly using the following command: ./nextflow run NETISCE.nf -resume 6.3 Results Herein, we will focus on the results that are deposited in the results folder by NETISCE. However, each step of the nextflow pipeline produces its corresponding raw results (for example, the entire attractor state for network simulations initialized with experimental data). If you are interested in looking at those raw results, they can be found within the work folder. We provide workfiles.txt which is a guide to which folders/subfolders contain the relevant results of each step. 6.3.1 General Results First, let’s take a look at the results that do not depend on the internal-marker node set. FVS finding The FVS solving algorithm identified one FVS, containing 6 nodes. name Sox2 Nanog Gata6 Tbx3 Oct4 Klf4 Attractor landscape estimation via k-means analysis Now, let’s look at the results of k-means analysis. First, NETISCE determines the optimal number of k clusters by computing the elbow and silhouette metrics. Figure 6.1: optimal k as identified by a) the elbow and b) silhouette metrics We see that the optimal k assessed by the elbow metric was k=4, while the optimal k identified by the silhouette metric was k=2. NETISCE automatically chooses the smaller k value, after checking that the attractors generated from the ESC samples and EpiSC samples do not appear in the same cluster. k=2 was selected for k-means optimal k, and we can see that the attractors generated from the ESC samples and EpiSC samples do not appear in separate clusters. name clusters ESC_1 0 ESC_2 0 ESC_3 0 EpiSC_1 1 EpiSC_2 1 EpiSC_3 1 Pertrubations on FVS control nodes that pass criterion 1 With 6 FVS control nodes, NETISCE performed 729 simulations of combinations of perturbations on the FVS control nodes. The resulting attractors were classified to the clusters produced from the k-means analysis using Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Machine Learning classification algorithms. Then, the perturbations are filtered by which of their corresponding attractors were classified to the ESC cluster by at least 2 of the 3 methods. These results can be found in crit1_perts.txt. Here we show the first 10 rows. ## [1] &quot;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 1: 375&quot; x pert_8 pert_17 pert_26 pert_35 pert_44 pert_53 pert_88 pert_89 pert_97 pert_98 6.3.2 Results using 4 internal-marker nodes The relevant files have the prefix ‘original’ in the github repository Our second perturbation filtering criterion identifies perturbations where, in their corresponding attractors, 90% of the steady state values for internal-marker nodes that are within the steady state expression ranges in the attractors generated from the ESC experimental data. First, let’s take a look at the steady state values of the internal-marker nodes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog in the attractors generated from the ESC and EpiSC experimental data. The values can be found in the original-exp_internalmarkers.txt and are plotted in original-experimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 6.2: histograms of 4 internal-marker node values We see that the values of the internal-markers for the pluripotent state (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog) are higher in the attractors generated from the experimental data of the ESCs than the attractors generated from the experimental data of the EpiSCs, and the makrer of the epiblast stem state is higher in the attractors generated from the experimental data of the EpiSCs than in the attractors generated from the experimental data of the ESC. Now, we can take a look at the attractors that passed filtering criterion 2.

This aligns with their role as maintainers of pluripotency. The steady-state values of the internal-marker nodes for these perturbations can be found in pert1_internal_markers.txt. A perturbation on the FVS control node, Nanog overexpression (pert_445), was also identified in Yachie-Kinoshita et al. and experimentally verified to shift cells from the EpiSC state towards the ESC state. We can plot the internal-marker node values using a radar plot. We can also plot Klf4 overexpression. This was a perturbation identified by Yachie-Kinoshita et al. to shift cells from the EpiSC state towards the ESC state. However, in our analyses, this perturbation (pert_365), did pass filtering criterion 1, but did not pass filtering criterion 2. library(fmsb) attr_pert&lt;-read.delim(&quot;ipsc/results/pert1_internal_markers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) attr_pert &lt;-attr_pert[c(&#39;pert_445&#39;,&#39;pert_365&#39;),c(&#39;Oct4&#39;,&quot;Sox2&quot;,&quot;Nanog&quot;,&quot;EpiTFs&quot;)] exp&lt;-read.delim(&quot;ipsc/results/original-exp_internalmarkers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) EpiSC_avg&lt;-colMeans(exp[4:6,]) ESC_avg&lt;-colMeans(exp[1:3,]) d1&lt;-rbind(EpiSC_avg,ESC_avg,attr_pert) rownames(d1)[1:4]&lt;- c(&quot;EpiSC&quot;, &quot;ESC&quot;,&quot;Nanog overexpression&quot;,&quot;Klf4 overexpression&quot;) maxcol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, max) mincol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, min) d2&lt;-rbind(maxcol,mincol, d1) rownames(d2)[1:2]&lt;- c(&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Min&quot;) par(mar = c(4, 0.1, 4, 0.1)) for (i in 5:nrow(d2)) { create_beautiful_radarchart(d2[c(1:4, i), ],color = c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;),caxislabels = seq(round(min(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),round(max(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),.2),title =row.names(d2)[i]);legend(x=0.4, y=1.4, legend =c(&quot;average EpiSC&quot;,&quot;average ESC&quot;,row.names(d2)[i]) , bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch=20 , col=c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;) , text.col = &quot;black&quot;, cex=1, pt.cex=2) } Figure 6.3: radar charts of the steady-state values of 4 internal-marker nodes for Nanog overexpression and Klf4 overexpression perturbation We see here, indeed that the values for Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, (when considered these three genes as internal-marker nodes) and EpiTFs are within the expected range for Nanog overexpression, but the values of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog in the attractor generated from Klf4 overexpression do not reach the values of the ESC state. 6.3.3 Results using 7 internal-marker nodes The relevant files have the prefix ‘expanded’ in the github repository. We explored filtering the 132 perturbations that passed the second filtering criterion by adding additional internal-marker nodes associated with pluripotency. We added 3 nodes, Lefty1, Pitx2 (transcription factors active in EpiSCs), and Esrrb (transcription factor active in ESCs) to the 4 previously used internal-marker nodes. Let’s look at the steady state values of the internal-marker nodes in the attractors generated from the ESC and EpiSC experimental data. The values can be found in the expanded-exp_internalmarkers.txt and are plotted in expanded-experimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 6.4: histograms of 7 internal-marker node values Again, the internal-marker nodes have the correct expression patterns within the attractors generated from the ESC and EpiSC states.

If your hpc uses a different executor, please update those specifications in the nextflow.config file in the directory. Please see https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html for more information regarding your executor. For ease of reproduction, we have included all files necessary to reproduce the reported results directly in the directory. We highly recommend you run this simulation on an hpc, as you will be generating files of 3Gb+. We have included the bash file we used on our SLURM executor. Note: within the NETISCE_mutations.nf configuration file, you will want to change the params.internal_control line if you want to use a different set of internal-marker nodes. #!/usr/bin/env nextflow params.expressions = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/expression.csv&quot; params.network = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/network.sif&quot; params.samples = &quot;$baseDir/input_data/samples.txt&quot; params.internal_control=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/internal-marker-1.txt&quot; params.mutations=&quot;$baseDir/input_data/mutations.csv&quot; params.alpha = 0.9 params.undesired = &#39;resistant&#39; params.desired = &#39;sensitive&#39; params.filter =&quot;strict&quot; As discussed in our paper, we filtered the perturbations using the original 3 internal-marker nodes for apoptosis, proliferation, and MAPK signaling. We further filtered perturbations on the FVS control nodes using 17 addition internal-marker nodes, related to the phenotypes of apoptosis, proliferation, and MAPK signaling. Therefore, to use a set of internal-marker nodes, please point to the correct input-data file. We created folders within the results folder to house the relevant internal-marker node files for each set. You may want to do the same as to not overwrite them (or move them into a separate folder). Additionally, when you run the nextflow command, please be sure to use the -resume flag so that you use the cached computations that do not need to be re-computed You can run NETISCE directly from this folder using the following command: ./nextflow run NETISC_mutations.nf -resume 7.3 Results Herein, we will focus on the results that are deposited in the results folder by NETISCE. However, each step of the nextflow pipeline produces its corresponding raw results (for example, the entire attractor state for network simulations initialized with experimental data). If you are interested in looking at those raw results, they can be found within the work folder. We provide workfiles.txt which is a guide to which folders/subfolders contain the relevant results of each step. 7.3.1 General Results First, let’s take a look at the results that do not depend on the internal-marker node set. FVS finding Here we focus on one of the FVSes in the network, which we call, Set 1. name AKT1 CCNA1 CTNNB1 E2F1 GRB2 MAPK1 MAPK14 MAPK8 MDM2 PDK1 SMAD7 SRC TP53 TSC1 Set 1 contains 14 nodes. Notice that TP53 is included in the FVS. This is a mutant gene in HT29 cells. NETISCE_mutations automatically filters out mutated genes, and places the FVS without mutated genes in the fvs-no-mutated-genes.txt file. and we remove mutated genes! name AKT1 CCNA1 CTNNB1 E2F1 GRB2 MAPK1 MAPK14 MAPK8 MDM2 PDK1 SMAD7 SRC TSC1 Attractor landscape estimation via k-means analysis Now, let’s look at the results of k-means analysis. First, NETISCE determines the optimal number of k clusters by computing the elbow and silhouette metrics. Figure 7.1: optimal k as identified by a) the elbow and b) silhouette metrics We see that the optimal k assessed by both the elbow metric and silhouette metric was k=3. NETISCE checkes to make sure that the untreated, MAPK inihibitor therapy resistant, and MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitive attractors are all separate. We can look at those results in the kmeans.txt file. name clusters HT29 0 HT29_BRAFiEGFRi 2 HT29_BRAFi 1 Pertrubations on FVS control nodes that pass criterion 1 With 13 FVS control nodes, NETISCE performed 1,594,323 simulations of combinations of perturbations on the FVS control nodes. The resulting attractors were classified to the clusters produced from the k-means analysis using Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Machine Learning classification algorithms. Then, the perturbations are filtered by which of their corresponding attractors were classified to the MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitive cluster by at least 2 of the 3 methods. These results can be found in crit1_perts.txt. Here we show the first 10 rows. ## [1] &quot;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 1: 232114&quot; x pert_0 pert_1 pert_2 pert_9 pert_10 pert_11 pert_18 pert_19 pert_20 pert_27 7.3.2 Results using 3 internal-marker nodes The relevant files have the prefix ‘original’ in the github repository Our second perturbation filtering criterion identifies perturbations where, in their corresponding attractors, 90% of the steady state values for internal-marker nodes that are within the steady state expression ranges in the attractor representing MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitivity. First, let’s take a look at the steady state values of the internal-marker nodes CASP3, CCNE1, and MAPK1 in the attractors generated from the untreated HT29 with simulated BRAFi (resistant) and BRAFi+EGFRi (sensitive). The values can be found in the exp_internalmarkers.txt and are plotted in -experimental_internalmarkers.pdf: Figure 7.2: histograms of 3 internal-marker node values We see that the value of the internal-marker for the apoptosis (CASP3) is higher and the steady-state values of the internal-marker nodes for proliferation (CCNE1) and MAPK signaling (MAPK1) are lower in the MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitive associated attractor than the MAPK inhibitor therapy resistance and untreated associated attractors.

The steady-state values of the internal-marker nodes for these perturbations can be found in pert1_internal_markers.txt. The combination BRAFi+SRCi treatment was identified and experimentally validated by Park et al., to overcome adaptive resistance to MAPK inhibitor therapy in HT29 cells. This perturbation, pert_797158, passed both of our filtering criteria.

The individual results for all three sets can be found in their respective folders on github: apoptosis-marker-nodes mapk-marker-nodes proliferation-marker-nodes We are interested in perturbations on FVS control nodes that pass the filtering criterion for each of the three phenotypes (i.e., the 90% threshold for steady-state values is met separately for each of the sets of apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and proliferation nodes). We can plot the node perturbation trends for these perturbations. allthree&lt;-crit2_3[c(Reduce(intersect, list(row.names(crit2_3),row.names(crit2_apop),row.names(crit2_prolif),row.names(crit2_mapk)))),] print(paste0(&#39;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 2: &#39;,nrow(allthree))) ## [1] &quot;number of perturbations that pass filtering criteria 2: 1266&quot; d4&lt;-allthree[,c(1:13)] %&gt;% transpose() %&gt;% as.matrix() row.names(d4)&lt;-colnames(allthree[1:13]) colnames(d4)&lt;-row.names(allthree) d4r&lt;-reshape2::melt(d4) %&gt;% select(-Var2) ggplot(d4r, aes(x=value)) + facet_wrap(~Var1,scales = &quot;free_x&quot;,shrink=FALSE) + geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/ncol(d4),fill=value)) + scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+ theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(4, &quot;mm&quot;)) + scale_fill_manual(values=Tol_muted) + ylab(&quot;% of specified perturbation to an FVS control node across all \\n combinations of perturbations that passed filtering criteria &quot;) + xlab(&quot;node perturbation&quot;) Figure 7.5: the precentage of specific perturbations on FVS control nodes in the perturbations that passed the filtering criteria For perturbations that pass the 2nd filtering criterion using internal-marker nodes for apoptosis, MAPK sigaling and proliferation, we see that in 100% of the perturbations SRC is downregulated. In the majority of of perturbations, TSC1 is upregulated, and GRB2 is downregulated. The two smallest sets of perturbations that passed the filtering criteria were BRAFi+SRCi+TSC1overexpression (pert_797159) and BRAFi+SRCi+GRB2i (pert_790597). We can make radar charts for each phenotype’s internal marker nodes to show that the steady-state values for the internal marker-nodes produced from these perturbations are within the gene expression range of the MAPK inhibitor therapy sensitivty assocaited attractor (HT29_BRAFi+EGFRi). attr_pert&lt;-read.delim(&quot;crc/results/apoptosis-marker-nodes/pert_internal_markers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) attr_pert &lt;-attr_pert[c(&#39;pert_797159&#39;,&#39;pert_790597&#39;),] exp&lt;-read.delim(&quot;crc/results/apoptosis-marker-nodes/exp_internalmarkers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) exp&lt;-exp[c(2,3),] d1&lt;-rbind(exp,attr_pert) rownames(d1)[3:4]&lt;- c(&quot;HT29_BRAFi+SRCi+TSCovr&quot;,&quot;HT29_BRAFi+SRCi+GRB2i&quot;) maxcol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, max) mincol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, min) d2&lt;-rbind(maxcol,mincol, d1) rownames(d2)[1:2]&lt;- c(&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Min&quot;) par(mar = c(4, 0.1, 4, 0.1)) for (i in 5:nrow(d2)) { create_beautiful_radarchart(d2[c(1:4, i), ],color = c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;),caxislabels = seq(round(min(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),round(max(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),.2),title =row.names(d2)[i]);legend(x=0.4, y=1.4, legend =c(row.names(d2)[c(3,4,i)]) , bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch=20 , col=c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;) , text.col = &quot;black&quot;, cex=1, pt.cex=2) } Figure 7.6: radar charts of the steady-state values of apoptosis internal-marker nodes for HT29_BRAFi+SRCi_TSCovr and HT29_BRAFi+SRCi_GRB2i attr_pert&lt;-read.delim(&quot;crc/results/proliferation-marker-nodes/pert_internal_markers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) attr_pert &lt;-attr_pert[c(&#39;pert_797159&#39;,&#39;pert_790597&#39;),] exp&lt;-read.delim(&quot;crc/results/proliferation-marker-nodes/exp_internalmarkers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) exp&lt;-exp[c(2,3),] d1&lt;-rbind(exp,attr_pert) rownames(d1)[3:4]&lt;- c(&quot;HT29_BRAFi+SRCi+TSCovr&quot;,&quot;HT29_BRAFi+SRCi+GRB2i&quot;) maxcol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, max) mincol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, min) d2&lt;-rbind(maxcol,mincol, d1) rownames(d2)[1:2]&lt;- c(&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Min&quot;) par(mar = c(4, 0.1, 4, 0.1)) for (i in 5:nrow(d2)) { create_beautiful_radarchart(d2[c(1:4, i), ],color = c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;),caxislabels = seq(round(min(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),round(max(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),.2),title =row.names(d2)[i]);#legend(x=0.4, y=1.4, legend =c(row.names(d2)[c(3,4,i)]) , bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch=20 , col=c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;) , text.col = &quot;black&quot;, cex=1, pt.cex=2) } Figure 7.7: radar charts of the steady-state values of apoptosis internal-marker nodes for HT29_BRAFi+SRCi_TSCovr and HT29_BRAFi+SRCi_GRB2i attr_pert&lt;-read.delim(&quot;crc/results/mapk-marker-nodes/pert_internal_markers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) attr_pert &lt;-attr_pert[c(&#39;pert_797159&#39;,&#39;pert_790597&#39;),] exp&lt;-read.delim(&quot;crc/results/mapk-marker-nodes/exp_internalmarkers.txt&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;,row.names = 1) exp&lt;-exp[c(2,3),] d1&lt;-rbind(exp,attr_pert) rownames(d1)[3:4]&lt;- c(&quot;HT29_BRAFi+SRCi+TSCovr&quot;,&quot;HT29_BRAFi+SRCi+GRB2i&quot;) maxcol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, max) mincol&lt;-apply(d1, 2, min) d2&lt;-rbind(maxcol,mincol, d1) rownames(d2)[1:2]&lt;- c(&quot;Max&quot;, &quot;Min&quot;) par(mar = c(4, 0.1, 4, 0.1)) for (i in 5:nrow(d2)) { create_beautiful_radarchart(d2[c(1:4, i), ],color = c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;),caxislabels = seq(round(min(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),round(max(d2[c(1:4, i),]),1),.2),title =row.names(d2)[i]);#legend(x=0.4, y=1.4, legend =c(row.names(d2)[c(3,4,i)]) , bty = &quot;n&quot;, pch=20 , col=c(&quot;#00AFBB&quot;, &quot;#E7B800&quot;,&quot;#FC4E07&quot;) , text.col = &quot;black&quot;, cex=1, pt.cex=2) } Figure 7.8: radar charts of the steady-state values of apoptosis internal-marker nodes for HT29_BRAFi+SRCi_TSCovr and HT29_BRAFi+SRCi_GRB2i "],["netisce-in-galaxy-project.html", "8 NETISCE in Galaxy Project 8.1 Installing Galaxy 8.2 Installing the NETISCE tool from Galaxy Tool Shed. 8.3 Downloading the NETISCE workflow.", " 8 NETISCE in Galaxy Project We have implemented NETISCE as a Galaxy Project tool. This allows users to run NETISCE analysis without programming knowledge. Herein are brief instructions for downloading and installing the Galaxy Project Tool and Workflow. 8.1 Installing Galaxy Please follow the instructions for installing a local version of Galaxy here: https://galaxyproject.org/admin/get-galaxy/ Follow instructions up to “Install Tools”. 8.2 Installing the NETISCE tool from Galaxy Tool Shed. First launch Galaxy by inputting sh run.sh in your terminal and load the GUI (navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser of choice). Then, after you have established your admin account and are logged in, you will be able to download the NETSICE tool. Click on the Admin button in the top ribbon: Under Tool Management, select “Install and Uninstall”. This will lead you to the search repositories page. You can search for the NETISCE tool by typing “netisce” into the search bar. Click on “netisce” and select Install. You can choose to Install additional dependencies (this is especially useful if you have installed Galaxy in a conda environment). You can specify the header under which you want to install netisce (we suggest “NETISCE”) 8.3 Downloading the NETISCE workflow. The fastest way to download the NETISCE workflow is to direct download it from here: https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Netisce/blob/049aec40e76c6b1d965aa199a041e0651fadd29b/Galaxy-Workflow-NETISCE.ga Alternatively, you can launch galaxy from https://usegalaxy.org/ In the upper ribbon, navigate to “Shared Data” -&gt; “Workflows”. Here you can search for “netisce” Click the dropdown arrow and select “save as file.” Using either downloaded file, in your local Galaxy, navigate to the “Workflow” page. Select import in the right-hand corner. Upload the .ga file. Once the Netisce workflow appears, on the righthand side, press the run button This will load the workflow.You will be presented with parameters to fill in (either text or files). You can use the same sample files as are used in the toy example nextflow run. Once you have uploaded your files and filled in other parameters, press “Run Workflow”. You can monitor the progress of your run on the right hand side. when all jobs are complete, you can view the report of your workflow, which contains all resutls files.
