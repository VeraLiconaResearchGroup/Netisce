# Pluripotent Stem Cell Example

This folder contains instructions to reproduce the results of simulating perturbations on FVS control nodes in a pluripotent stem cell signaling. The goal of these simulations is to identify targets that can reprogram cells from the Epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) fate towards the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) fate.

The original study of reversion of primed pluripotency in mouse epiblast stem cells was performed by Yachie-Kinoshita et al. in "[Modeling signaling-dependent pluripotency with Boolean logic to predict cell fate transitions (Molecular Systems Biology (2018)14:e7952)](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20177952)". The network and internal-marker nodes were extracted from the publication and its supplementary material. The normalized expression data used for initial activities in NETISCE can be found at [GSE62155](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62155).
