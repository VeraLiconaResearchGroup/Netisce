# Cell Fate Specification in Ascidian Embryo


This folder contains instructions to reproduce the results of simulating FVS control node perturbations in a model of ascidian embryo cell specification. You can read the original report here: link


The original studies of Cell Fate Specification in the Ascidian Embryo were performed by Kobayashi et al. in "[Using linkage logic theory to control dynamics of a gene regulatory network of a chordate embryo (Sci Rep 11, 4001 (2021))](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83045-y)". The network, internal-marker nodes, and FVS was derived from the publication and its supplementary material.
