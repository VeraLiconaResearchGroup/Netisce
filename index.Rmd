# About

Welcome to the NETISCE manual and tutorials.

NETISCE is a network-based approach for cellular reprogramming. This manual contains instructions for installing the NETISCE pipeline tool and accessing the Galaxy Project GUI web-based tool. We provide a simple toy example walkthrough tutorial. Lastly, we include instructions for reproducing NETISCE cell reprogramming results in developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology.

NETISCE identifies combinations of perturbations to be applied on a gene regulatory or signaling network to trigger a shift from an undesired to a desired cell fate. The core of the pipeline is the application of structure-based control theory to identify control nodes that drive the system from an initial state that would lead to an attractor associated with an undesired phenotype and towards an attractor associated with the desired phenotype.
