# About

Welcome to the NETISCE manual and tutorials.

Cell-fate reprogramming is a powerful type of cellular reprogramming which aims to drive a system from a selected initial state towards a desired phenotype. However, methods for identifying reprogramming targets remain limited in biological systems that lack large sets of experimental data or dynamical characterization. We present here NETISCE, a novel computational method for identifying cell-fate reprogramming targets and their perturbations in static networks through the   application of control theory and dynamical systems frameworks to a network-based analysis. Our method only requires a static network and the gene expression data for the initial state of the system. We validate NETISCE in studies of cell-fate reprogramming from developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology. Our results show that NETISCE can predict previously identified cell-fate reprogramming target perturbations in these systems, and identify potentially novel combinations of targets. This work extends cell-fate reprogramming studies beyond fully parameterized models and can be used by experimental and computational biologists to guide their cell-fate reprogramming studies.

This manual contains instructions for installing the NETISCE pipeline tool and accessing the Galaxy Project GUI web-based tool. We provide a simple toy example walkthrough tutorial. Lastly, we include instructions for reproducing NETISCE cell reprogramming results in developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology.
