exists.not.function     Does object exist ignoring functions The
                        exists() function can tell you whether an
                        object exists at all, or whether an object
                        exists with a certain type, but it can be
                        useful to know whether an object exists as
                        genuine data (and not a function) which can be
                        important when a variable or object is
                        accidently or intentionally given the same name
                        as a function. This function usually returns a
                        logical value as to the existence of the object
                        (ignoring functions) but can also be set to
                        return the non-function type if the object
                        exists.
