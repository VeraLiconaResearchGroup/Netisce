R Package - fastICA

INTRODUCTION

This file explains how to install the R package fastICA. I assume
that you have a basic knowledge of UNIX/LINUX and that you already
have R installed on your machine.

INSTALLATION

1. Download the g-zipped tar archive  fastICA_*.*-*.tar.gz

2.  Install the package using     

	R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/LIB fastICA_*.*-*.tar.gz

/path/to/LIB should be the library directory where you wish to put the package.

If you have root access to your machine then use 

	R CMD INSTALL fastICA_*.*-*.tar.gz

and the package will be put into the default R library tree.

5. You can then start an R session and load the package using

	library(fastICA,lib.loc="/path/to/LIB")

or 

 library(fastICA) 

(if you installed the package into the default R library tree)
