Package: tictoc
Title: Functions for timing R scripts, as well as implementations of
        Stack and List structures.
Version: 1.0
Author: Sergei Izrailev
Maintainer: Sergei Izrailev <sizrailev@collective.com>
Description: This package provides the timing functions 'tic' and 'toc' that
    can be nested. One can record all timings while a complex script is
    running, and examine the values later. It is also possible to instrument
    the timing calls with custom callbacks. In addition, this package provides
    class 'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class 'List', implemented as a
    list, both of which support operations 'push', 'pop', 'first', 'last' and
    'clear'.
