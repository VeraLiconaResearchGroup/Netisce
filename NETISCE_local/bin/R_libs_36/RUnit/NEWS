Changes in RUnit 0.4.32
    o   runTestSuite and runTestFile takes additional gcBeforeTest parameter 
        (default FALSE). This disables running garbage collector before timing 
        the test. 
        This setting speeds up the test suite 
        at the cost of making individual test timing less reliable.
        When trying to optimize tests for speed, set gcBeforeTest to TRUE for
        more reliable timing information.
    o   added .Rinstignore to cut down on warnings when building the package
    o   removed Biobase specific tests, replaced with direct S4 class creation
    o   fixed CRAN URLs in README.md

Changes in RUnit 0.4.31
    o   checkEquals and others output optional message on separate line

Changes in RUnit 0.4.30

        extended validity checks

Changes in RUnit 0.4.25
    o   enable redirection of error and log messages to file, controlled via new 
        global option 'outfile', (following a suggestion by Seth Falcon)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.24
    o   added RUnit specific options 'verbose' and 'silent' to global options list 
        to allow control of test log output
    o   moved unit tests from tests/ to inst/unitTests 
    o   added Makefile for executing unit tests (using R wiki example)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.23
    o   vignette: fixed function name in example code, reported by  Blair Christian
    o   init .testLogger to avoid R CMD check NOTE messages
    o   allow verbosity of console output log to be controlled: added 'verbose' argument
        to runTestFile and runTestSuite (following a suggestion by Seth Falcon)
    o   test logger object declared as S3 class 'TestLogger'

Changes in RUnit 0.4.22
    o   clarified applicable license: GPL 2
    o   defineTestSuite: gained some argument checks
    o   isValidTestSuite: check for empty name
    o   includeTracker: fix `<- if` handling

Changes in RUnit 0.4.21
    o   documentation issues corrected, identified by new R 2.9.0 devel Rd parser

Changes in RUnit 0.4.20
    o   test protocol generation on Mac OS X failed due to incorrect code to identify
        'gcc' version  
    o   Rd documentation updated

Changes in RUnit 0.4.19
    o   test protocol now states check number per test case
    o   changed check for object class to is() to allow derived class objects to pass 
        (suggested by Philippe Grosjean)
    o   removed start up message

Changes in RUnit 0.4.18
    o   seq_along introduced instead of seq( ) for efficiency and R version dependency set to 
        2.4.0 when seq_along was introduced
    o   some small changes to avoid warnings with options(warnPartialMatchArgs=TRUE)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.17
    o   corrected documentation example code
 
Changes in RUnit 0.4.16
    o   changed the environment test code files are evaluated, now 
        a new environment outside the RUnit namespace is utilized,
        allowing e.g. setClass calls without specifying where=.GlobalEnv
    o   updated documentation to use encoding latin1
    o   use LazyLoad: yes instead of SaveImage:yes (to be deprecated for R 2.6.0)
    o   internal error handler rewritten to be more failure robust
    o   added new test cases for .setUp and .tearDown, extended tests
        to cover S4 class and method behaviour in check* functions
    o   example on S4 virtual class testing added
    o   utility function to compare to RUnitTestResult objects added:
        concept idea for comparing and optimizing test suite
        performance (share/R/checkCode.r)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.15
    o   compatibility to R 1.9.0 as declared in DESCRIPTION: removed calls to isTRUE 
        as this was introduced only in R 2.1.0, replaced where needed by identical(TRUE, x)
    o   fixed printHTMLProtocol: on Windows Makeconf does not exist so
        CC compiler used by R cannot be queried this way (reported by
        Tobias Verbeke)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.14
    o   stated all package dependencies in DESCRIPTION, required for R
        2.4.0 compatibility
    
Changes in RUnit 0.4.13
    o   allow the RNG to be set by the user via new arguments 'rngKind' and 
        'rngNormalKind' to functions defineTestSuite and runTestFile (patch by Seth Falcon)
    o   fixed exit status: RNG kind was left changed after runTestSuite execution in 
        user workspace
    o   email contact address modified

Changes in RUnit 0.4.12
    o   allow *.R test case file extension (suggested by Gregor Gorjanc)
    o   fixed code typo in example vignette (spotted by Gregor Gorjanc)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.11
    o   checkException: argument silent added to allow to suppress
        error messages emitted by the failing function
    o   inspect: added argument track, which _has_ to be provided
        at each invocation to avoid recursive default argument
        reference call errors (experimental: subject to change if this
        leads to new incompatibilities)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.9
    o   checkEquals has new compatibility argument checkNames

Changes in RUnit 0.4.8
    o   checkIdentical added, to allow to check for exact identity

Changes in RUnit 0.4.7
    o   update for checkEqualsNumeric to be compatible with R 2.3.0

Changes in RUnit 0.4.5
    o   improvements to error detection in runTestSuite

Changes in RUnit 0.4.4
    o   changed maintainer

Changes in RUnit 0.4.2
    o   checkTrue: corrected handling of named logical arguments

Changes in RUnit 0.4.1
    o   printHTMLProtocol has new parameter 'testFileToLinkMap'
        to allow to provide a function to add dynamically generated
        URLs for each test case file, e.g. for use with CVSweb

Changes in RUnit 0.4.0

    o   New 'error' category DEACTIVATED introduced: If the function
        DEACTIVATED is inserted into a test function the function
        stops at that point and is reported as deactivated in the test
        protocol.

    o   New function 'getErrors' which takes a list of type
        'RUnitTestData' and returns some very basic error information
        of a test run.

    o   The name of the currently executed test function is written to
        standard out.

    o   'printHTMLProtocol' fixed such that it does not produce a
        warning anymore.

    o   Dependency on package 'splines' removed.

    o   Various small fixes of the documentation.
