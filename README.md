# Netisce
This repository contains the scripts of Netisce as well as the data and computation for the method's validation.

NETISCE identifies reprogramming targets through the innovative use of control theory within a dynamical systems framework. NETISCE extends cell fate reprogramming studies to larger-scale biological networks without the need for full model parameterization and can be implemented by experimental and computational biologists to identify parts of a biological system that are relevant for the desired reprogramming task.
